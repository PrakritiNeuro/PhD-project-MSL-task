------------------
Can use KbCheck & KbWait to determine whether any key is down now.

Pass a list of keycodes to be ignored by KbCheck and KbWait.
See "help DisableKeysForKbCheck" on how to do this.

---

Add a ListenChar(2) command at the beginning of your script and 
a ListenChar(0) to the end of your script to disable/enable transmission of 
keypresses to Matlab.

If your script should abort and your keyboard is dead,
press CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input
It is the same as ListenChar(0). See 'help ListenChar' for more info.

 'deviceNumber'
	-1, KbCheck will query all keyboard devices and
	return their "merged state" - The 'keyCode' vector will represent
	the state of all keys of all keyboards, and the 'keyIsDown' flag will be
	equal to one if at least one key on any of the keyboards is pressed.
	
	-2, KbCheck will query all keypad devices (if any) and
	return their "merged state", 
	
	-3, KbCheck will query all keyboard and keypad devices and
	return their "merged state".
